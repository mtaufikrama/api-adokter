The phpDocumentor team would like to announce the release of phpDocumentor
1.3.0.  This release adds in PHP 5 support, highlighting of tutorial XML,
beautifying of output from the XML:DocBook/peardoc2:default converter,
and fixes a few bugs found in 1.2.3.1.  In addition, output from source highlighting
is much more efficient, resulting in slightly smaller file size for sourcecode=on.
Also, multi-national characters are now allowed in a package name - at your own risk.
I found that Apache 1.3 could not serve files with multi-national characters, but
when loaded directly from disk, web browsers did just fine.

------
IMPORTANT: phpDocumentor 1.3.0 requires PHP version 4.2.0 or greater.
phpDocumentor will function best with PHP version 4.3.0 or greater, as it will
use of the tokenizer extension if php 4.3.0 is installed for a tremendous
increase in parsing speed.
------
WARNING: The PDF Converter will not work in PHP5.  The PDF library that it relies upon
segfaults with the simplest of files.  Generation still works great in PHP4
------

Speaking of speed, do NOT run the PDF Converter with --sourcecode = on for any
medium to large sized projects.  I had to kill a PDF generation after 36 hours
on a Pentium IV 2.66GHz computer - 36 hours!  The design of the PDF generation
library is tremendously inefficient, probably on the order of O(n^2).  I'd fix
this if I knew anything about PDF.  If there are any users out there with the
time and expertise to look into the algorithms used by CPdf, we would all
appreciate it.

This version removes the unmaintained and not very useful dia2codeConverter

A full listing of all closed bugs and feature requests can be found in the 
next section of the notes
